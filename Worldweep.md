<h1 id="children-of-worldweep">Children of Worldweep</h1>
<p>The world weeps.</p>
<p>There was once an alchemist, a rare genius of her craft. Her inventions could have, in other circumstances, changed the world for the better. But she was bitter, for despite her astonishing intellect, she had not one iota of talent for magic. Her refusal to give up drove her down darker and darker paths; by the end of her journey she was far beyond science, and well past mere insanity.</p>
<p>What she created might seem an innocuous curiosity: a brass orb, dotted with odd protrusions and colorful wires. And yet it weighed on the world around it with an unnatural gravity. For some reason, just looking at it gave you headaches. Deities felt it like a scream in the cosmos. Diviners everywhere suddenly found that the future came to an abrupt stop very, very shortly. Astrologers observing the night sky noted that the stars seemed to be moving with new speed and purpose, as if they were suddenly fleeing away from Golarion.</p>
<p>The world immediately declared war on the alchemist. Mighty paladins, majestic warlords, undead tyrants… all came together in a grand Heroes’ March upon her tower in a moment of unparalleled unity. They failed.</p>
<p>Before the heroes could battle through the alchemist’s twisted creations to reach the orb, it detonated. Any within the tower were instantly vaporized; their fate may have been kinder than that of the survivors. The explosion tore straight through simple reality to rip a gaping wound in the veil of the world - the Worldweep, a howling, oozing void that scoured sentience from witnesses like a sandstorm through the mind. The barriers between the planes were shattered as the blast found its true target. Pharasma’s Boneyard was torn apart in seconds, shattering the Cycle of Souls and forever dooming Golarion.</p>
<p>A millennia has passed since that fateful day. With Golarion’s mightiest heroes dead or insane, the world descended into a chaos that not even the gods could prevent. Billions have died through war, famine, and destitution. The survivors scrabble for what little scraps of the civilized world remain.</p>
<p>Your legacy is the legacy of the Heroes’ March, descended from one of those who tried - and failed - to prevent the apocalypse. And perhaps it is this legacy that provides you with your purpose. For the world is not truly dead, not while there are people still living and breathing on its surface. What were once mighty kingdoms are now ruins, but those ruins hold treasures and secrets ripe for the taking. With the aid of heroes like you, answering the peoples’ calls for help, the world may even one day, rise anew from the ashes.</p>
<p>Come, Hero. Redeem your ancestors’ failure, and rebuild the future of a doomed world.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Children of the Worldweep is a cooperative play world hosted on Discord that utilizes the Pathfinder 2E system. Players from all across the globe can make use of a unique setting and custom storytelling system in order to create a living world with emergent gameplay. A simplified, modular leveling system makes it easier for players to keep track of character progression. GMs can make use of loose adventure prompts to maintain continuity with the setting while simultaneously telling stories the way they want to. Every adventure contributes to global progression, allowing characters and GMs to leave a lasting impact on the world.</p>
<h2 id="character-hooks">Character Hooks</h2>
<p>In the millennium that has passed since the destruction of the Boneyard, the remnants of society have spread and barely maintain a semblance of order. You are the children of those who failed to stop the Alchemist and her machinations. There is a tear in the weave at the site of the Heroes’ Failure. Any and all who gaze upon it feel the pull of death and lose their mind to the weave. Those who remain simply try to make a life of any kind. Children of the Worldweep, however, are not welcome. All heroes who were the progeny of those who failed Golarion are marked in the same way—a scar magically appears somewhere on their bodies and inexplicably allows them to look at the tear in the weave with no harm.</p>
<p>Thus, as the only ones who can approach the Worldweep without becoming a husk of themselves, Heroes are tasked to complete Bounties. The disgrace of their forefathers follows them everywhere else—finding other work is near-impossible for them, as non-marked survivors shun them entirely.</p>
<p>The world is ravaged by famine and chaos. No major cities remain standing—they’ve become ruins explored by would-be adventurers, inhabited by monsters and bandits waiting to prey on those unprepared. Major resources are rare and artisans have hidden themselves from the world. Travel is slow and mounts are harder to maintain and keep. The world puts the blame of your forefathers on you as the frustration of daily life brings them nothing but struggle. They tolerate you, as you are the only ones who can go near the worldweep, but nobody would lend you a hand in need. Only you and the other marked adventurers can rely on one another in this world.</p>
<p>The only beacon of community left is the Harbor of Hearts, the Adventurer’s Guild by created by your Guildlord Adrianna:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1108083704481460345/1115848024023900220/InkCommAdrianna.png?width=840&amp;height=905" alt="Adrianna"><br>
Adrianna is a Fetchling woman, but more importantly, she is your Guildlord. Although she deals with nearly every adventurer who comes her way and competently runs the Harbor of Hearts practically single-handedly, she is still strangely absent from many of its social occurrences, preferring instead to dedicate herself to her work of managing the guild as well as a deeply personal project that few have earned her confidence enough to learn. type in ?De’Aaron-Fox-will-be-All-NBA and hit enter into heroine of hearts. Rumors abound, of course, about what could capture her attention so thoroughly, and the most prevalent one is that the tearing of the Worldweep separated her from her wife, now stranded in the Shadowplane. It would take a brave soul to ask Adrianna this to her face, as her violet eyes invite few personal questions.</p>

<p>Modules, such as Adventure Paths and PFS Organized Play scenarios, are not allowed to be used for building characters or buying items.</p>
<p>Worldweep uses the Free Archetype Variant Rule from the Gamemastery Guide. For this reason, the Ancient Elf Heritage is banned. At 2nd level, Rogues with the Eldritch Trickster Racket gain the Magical Trickster Rogue Feat instead of a Free Archetype Feat.</p>
<p>You may rebuild your character as much as you’d like up until you reach 2nd level. All characters must start in Moonlit Village. Once you have created your new character, head to #settlement-map and react to the Moonlit Village post with the 🌔 emoji.</p>
<p>After the Heroes who marched on the Isle of Terror failed their mission, many prominent factions ceased to be. The Hellknights, Knights of Lastwall, Crimson Assassins, and others all either disappeared or were part of the Great March that was already decimated in the Worldweep. If there is any prerequisite that requires that an order be standing or that you need to be a member of that order, then that choice is not available to take. However a Background such as Student of Perfection which doesn’t require an order but simply a fighting style passed down from parent to child can be . Another example is the Academy Dropout background, it is reasonable that there are still some small academies that exist in the world that you dropped out of.</p>
<p>When you’ve completed your character on Pathbuilder, Wanderer’s Guide, your own brain, etc., simply share the character with your GM when asked. For 1st level characters, apply any earned gold <em>after</em> you have spent the starting gold. If you’d like, you may submit the character into the channel #Heroines’ Hearts [RP] in the Harbor of Hearts category for everyone to see.</p>
<p>The easiest way to remember these character building rules is to follow the general rule that: if it is rare then it is not usable. If the tags allow for it, then it is allowed. If you have any questions or problems you are always free to ask in the Discord channel #worldweep-faq.</p>
<p>Characters <strong>must</strong> be an adult of any ancestry or heritage. This is a <strong>zero tolerance rule.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your characters cannot interact or share an inventory or items with one another.</strong></p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Death for the Children of the Worldweep is permanent. If your character dies, they cannot be resurrected. Death is likely for the bold who wish to take on ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Bounties consistently. It is unlikely that you will survive such a hard encounter—much less a series of them.</p>
<h2 id="retiring">Retiring</h2>
<p>If you no longer wish to play a character, you can retire them. Write a suitable send-off in the relevant channel, tagging yourself. Mechanically, retirement is nearly the same as death. The character is permanently an NPC and unlikely to remain part of the larger story. They depart with all of their belongings. A character retired in this way cannot be un-retired.</p>
<h2 id="playing-in-the-weep">Playing in the Weep</h2>
<p>Signing up for Bounties is done on the r/Pathfinder2e Discord server in the relevant bounty channel. The guild will list the Bounty prompt and in the Bounty Board, GMs will create a new thread with the <strong>exact</strong> title for their game. Players will then sign up in the thread created. GMs set a time and players run the Bounty with the GM. GMs have <strong>full</strong> authority and discretion on whether or not they want to allow a player to play.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>For accounting’s sake, <strong>all games within Worldweep must be played and recorded in the r/Pathfinder2e discord or they will not count towards your character progression.</strong> This includes the text channels and the voice channels. Concerning Guilds, splinter discords or group chats for Guilds do not count as canon. If the events didn’t happen in a relevant channel on the r/Pathfinder2e discord server, then it doesn’t happen in-world. Please keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="time-marches-forward">Time Marches Forward</h2>
<p>Every two weeks (Sunday to Sunday) in real time all Bounties that have not been collected will simply disappear as no heroes have taken interest in them. New Bounties will go up every other Monday afternoon, and when they do, all old Bounties become void.</p>
<p>Downtime activities such as reclaiming a lost animal companion, retraining, etc. takes real time to complete. e.g. Reclaiming an animal companion takes one real-time week. Earned income and crafting for earned income is not an available activity for players.</p>
<h2 id="limited-communications">Limited Communications</h2>
<p>As you travel from settlement to settlement, you will lose communication to the towns you’ve left. Selecting a new settlement requires that you remove the citizenship of the last one even if you’re just visiting. This is to create immersion and promote exploration. Players found “cheating” and having multiple citizenship at the same time will be kindly asked to remove the one they’re not in and further breaking of the spirit of the rule will result in disappointment and potential removal from the game. To select your citizenship, go to the #settlement-map on discord and click the emoji that best aligns with your current citizenship.</p>
<h2 id="pings">Pings</h2>
<p>Playing Worldweep will require us to ping you often. When new Bounties drop, you will be pinged; when there is a new event, you will be pinged. If there’s an announcement of a change to the rules, you will be pinged. Feel free to mute the channels to get a break from the pings, but we cannot change the nature of how this game will be played. Please be aware that not following announcements may cause you to miss out on events.</p>
<p>=</p>
<h1 id="bounty-system">Bounty System</h1>
<p>Worldweep uses a Bounty system to level up rather than XP progression. As you complete Bounties you will earn stars that will accumulate to level your character. The more difficult the Bounty, the more stars you can receive.</p>
<h3 id="bounty">Bounty</h3>
<p>A Bounty is a quest that is put up on the Bounty board, a request of the heroes of Golarion to assist with various tasks. These quests can range from clearing a horde of demons to helping scholars acquire a relic to retrieving onions from a local field for a local chef. Characters can only participate in Bounties that are 3 levels higher or lower than their current level. See “That Time I…” for how to play down further. Each Bounty has a level rating and a star rating next to each name that indicates its level and difficulty.</p>
<p>“Level 3 ⭐⭐⭐” for example would be a bounty for 3rd-level characters valued at 3 stars of progress.</p>

</table><h3 id="bounty-rewards">Bounty Rewards</h3>
<p>Characters and GMs receive the bounty rewards whenever a group of characters complete a bounty successfully. Bounty rewards include all of the stars listed for that bounty, in addition to any gold, items, or other benefits that might be listed explicitly in the bounty description unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>GMs can gain as many stars as Bounties they run that week give and apply both the stars and the treasure to their characters unless the Bounty specified. Sometimes a Bounty will say you can only earn the Special Reward once; this is just for the item reward, not the stars or gold.</p>
<p>There are four kinds of rewards that adventurers can earn:</p>
<p><em><strong>Bounty Rewards</strong></em>: These provide ⭐ and gold (possibly adjusted at GM-discretion) as described on the Gold Per Star Per Player table. As an exception to the usual rules for Bounty Rewards, Bonus Rewards, and Special Rewards, characters who have already run a bounty that week may run any number of subsequent bounties for half-gold rewards. For every bounty after the first that a character runs, they receive half of the gold, rounded up, that they would have been eligible for had it been their first run of the week. No other Bounty Rewards or Special Rewards are received. A GM earns the Bounty Reward every time they run a Bounty (with the gold portion modified as described below).</p>
<p><em><strong>Bonus Rewards</strong></em>: These provide things like items, additional gold, or other benefits. They may be earned exactly once per character, including by GMs. If the bounty offers a Bonus Reward that the character has never earned from a previous run of the Bounty, they earn the Bonus Reward. This counts as having received the Bonus Reward, so it cannot be received again, even in future weeks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Settlement Rewards</strong></em>: These provide ✨ and other benefits for Settlements. A character can never receive a settlement reward. These rewards can be earned an unlimited number of times, but bounties that provide Settlement Rewards cost gold to run, as described in the Settlement Building section below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Special Rewards</strong></em>: These do exactly what they say. If a bounty is uncapped in some way, it will say so here. If it has different rules for rewards or running it, this describes how it works.</p>
<p>=</p>
<h2 id="severity-of-bounties">Severity of Bounties</h2>
<p>⭐ - This rating of Bounty should be run with the intent and idea that it has extremely low stakes. The threat of death is so small it might as well be 0. Death would have to happen at the hands of players running and jumping off a cliff. This does not mean the Bounty wouldn’t have any encounters. These encounters would just be trivial and of nearly no consequence.</p>
<p>⭐⭐ - As above, however the encounters would be a bit more difficult and the chance of death would increase by a small margin. These kinds of Bounties should be run with the idea of teaching players about dipping their toes into the game. Combat would be rated at low difficulty to give players an idea of how combat works but with no actual threat of death even with critical misses or hits.</p>
<p>⭐⭐⭐ - A moderate Bounty, the most plentiful across the guild. These Bounties should feel routine. Something that Heroes do on a normal day to day basis but also could go completely wrong at any point from bad rolls or just poor decisions. The encounters are moderate. These are tough-ish. The scenarios require skill feats and training and for players to figure out how to manage moderate encounters and monsters with seriousness. Be tough with players. For encounters, players will find out how the combat of Pathfinder 2 can become deadly and a TPK can happen with bad luck or poor tactical decisions. Roleplaying monsters as they would be is a must in this bounty mode. Social encounters, puzzles, traps and other things would cause a lot of inconvenience or problems for players and may even kill them on a critical failure, but players should have a good chance of success.</p>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐ - A severe Bounty generally would be a high risk of death, but with cooperation, party tactics, and average rolls, they should be able to succeed. Party members should feel that it is tough but not impossible. These are Bounties for heroes. These are Bounties that should make players feel invested and that there might be a risk of death should they not use a combination of buffs and debuffs as well as liberal application of healing. A critical failure or a low heal may mean a cascade of deaths. Players should feel that this is run fairly, but very harsh. GMs should try to encourage a lot of team play and all character builds should be viable.</p>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  - <strong>In this mode: You cannot speak during another person’s turn unless you spend a reaction to make a comment or direct a player. You cannot give specific commands on your turn unless you spend an action.</strong>. Players should consistently feel that they are at risk of mission failure and death. These are extreme encounters. Some may feel they should run some severe encounters mixed in with Extreme. In this Bounty mode, NO encounter should be less than severe. This rule <strong>only</strong> applies to Bounties that begin at this rating and not Bounties that turn into this rating, as some Bounties can turn into ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ due to circumstances beyond the player’s or GM’s control.</p>
<p>For example: Saying “follow me” would not cost an action but “flank him” would. “I’m going to cast fireball” would not cost an action but, “I’m going to cast a fireball in this square.” would.</p>
<p>For all Bounties, encounters cannot exceed the rating of the Bounty unless otherwise specified. If a Bounty is a ⭐⭐⭐ moderate Bounty, then the encounters cannot exceed a moderate encounter as rated by the <em>Building Encounters</em> rules in the Core Rule Book. This is to keep the expectations of players fair and that they know what they’re getting themselves into.</p>
<p>These guidelines keep Bounties unique and interesting despite multiple people running the same prompts. GMs are encouraged to be harsh without being unfair to the players. Play tactically, play with aggression. This is a world that is in ruins, and adventurers live a short and dangerous life.<br>
<strong>Not all Bounties require combat. Severe and Extreme social encounters or puzzles that can result in failure of the Bounty are also options. An example Bounty could be to recover a lost tablet wherein social checks, skill checks and other skills-based adventuring happens and if enough failure happens throughout the Bounty it results in a failure that could permanently lock out information or even give permanent banes to players.</strong></p>
<p>=</p>
<h2 id="leveling-and-treasure">Leveling and Treasure</h2>
<p>Once your character has collected enough stars from Bounties, they will level up. For non-Prestige Levels, this is 10 stars. Every Bounty also has a reward separate from the stars gained through successful completion of the Bounty. Characters will also gain gold according to the gold chart below. GMs will earn gold scaled to their character’s level.</p>
<p>For example, a Bounty will earn a  Level 1 character 20 gold. 4 stars * 5g per star = 20 gold. The GM who ran the Bounty will earn 4 stars * the scaled gold for their character. If the character is Level 4, they will earn 4 stars * 22g = 88g total. If the character is Level 10, they will earn 4 stars * 200g = 800g total.</p>
<p>While adventuring, if you gain an excess of stars necessary to level while completing Bounties, you can only carry over 1 star every level. For example, if, at level 1, you complete three Bounties worth ⭐⭐⭐ each for a total of 9 stars and then complete another ⭐⭐⭐ star Bounty, you can only roll over 1 star to the next level. If you completed 14 stars in one non-prestige level, you still will only roll over 1 star to the next level.</p>
<p>If a character levels up during the middle of a Play By Post, it’s up to your GM if they’ll allow you to level during or after. In either case, you must follow the star reward roll over rules. For example, if you had 9 stars and then gained 3 more at the end of the week, you may ask your GM how they feel about your character leveling up in the middle of the PBP. Whatever the case is, you will only carry 1 star into the next week.</p>
<p>Players and GMs can only gain gold according to the treasure rules above. During a Bounty, if you earn any items, gold, or loot not specified in the Bounty posting, you will have to forfeit them at the end of the Bounty.</p>

</table><p>*GMs can give +/- 50% of the total gold value in each Bounty if appropriate for players.</p>
<p>Gold rewards are tied directly to the Bounty level and the star level. So if you are a 3rd level character who plays a Level 2 ⭐⭐⭐ bounty, you will receive 27gp and not 39gp.</p>
<h2 id="play-by-post">Play-by-Post</h2>
<p>Play-By-Post players will receive the bounty rewards every week at the end of the week. When the Bounty is complete, they will receive the Bounty Reward amount in full immediately. Any Bounty with no Bounty Rewards is automatically considered uncapped. Settlement Bounties are considered uncapped for this purpose, but each character may run no more than one Settlement Bounty per week. See below for details on Settlement Bounties.</p>
<p>For example, if you start a ⭐⭐⭐ Play-By-Post game on a Wednesday, you will gain ⭐⭐⭐ on Sunday, assuming it has not concluded by then. If the Bounty is successful on the following Wednesday, then you will gain ⭐⭐⭐ and will be able to start another Bounty for rewards.</p>
<p>As long as you are gaining weekly stars in a Play-By-Post, you cannot gain full Bounty Rewards from another Bounty unless the Bounty says otherwise. You cannot gain full rewards from multiple Play-By-Posts at the same time. If you start a Bounty on a Sunday and your Bounty ends on the following Sunday, you earn ⭐⭐⭐ for completing the Bounty and then you can start and earn the reward and gain stars for the new week.</p>
<h2 id="roleplaying">Roleplaying</h2>
<p>Roleplaying in the Discord in the appropriate channels can earn you star rewards for participation. Players can earn between ⭐ and ⭐⭐⭐ a week, depending on how well they have roleplayed in their own ways, not in comparison to others. A player who has never role played and feels self-conscious about it, for example, would be displaying exceptional roleplay for making the minimum posts a week and deserves the maximum ⭐⭐⭐ reward. This is optional and a fun way to gain a few extra stars to build your characters and immerse yourselves in the world. The emphasis of this is to not rank yourself in comparison to others. Because these are self-assigned stars meant to help those who cannot commit to a weekly game, the reward is entirely based on how <strong>you</strong> have been exceptional to yourself. If you have a hard time role-playing, but you went out of your comfort zone to post and try, then that is exceptional. It is a designated reward on the value you have for yourself and what you have contributed to the community. If your character has <strong>only</strong> gained stars through RP, then you may receive the same amount of value in gold based on the gold chart above.</p>
<p>##GM Rewards ((+GM Rewards))<br>
GMs who run Bounties will receive the same Bonus Rewards, Special Rewards, and Settlement Rewards rewards awarded to players during a Bounty that they can apply to their characters.</p>
<p>However, they receive exactly ⭐⭐⭐⭐, regardless of the rating of the Bounty. Stars applied to a character this way are scaled to the level of the character to which they are applied; they do not “remember” what level Bounty they came from.</p>
<p>GMs can “bank” these stars and apply them to characters later. There is no limit to the number of stars that can be banked.</p>
<p>GMs that run Bounties that ultimately end in failure receive exactly ⭐⭐ and none of the other rewards.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a 3rd level character and run a 20th level Bounty, you will receive the gold scaled for a 3rd level character per the Bounty rating according to the reward chart. However, they cannot gain the extra gold they’ve applied as per the gold chart above. GMs are allowed to run as many adventures as they want but are still beholden to having 2 characters; however, they can apply as many Bounty rewards to those characters as they have earned from running games.</p>
<p>Additionally, on Sunday, when players receive Bounty Rewards, PBP GMs receive ⭐⭐⭐⭐ for each Bounty they are running, up to a maximum of eight stars. They also receive the normal ⭐⭐⭐⭐ and Bonus, Special, and Settlement Rewards when a Bounty completes successfully (or just ⭐⭐ on a failure).</p>
<h3 id="prestige-levels">Prestige Levels</h3>
<p>Prestige levels begin at 10th level. The reality of the weight of power comes with the responsibility of carrying more from around you. Once you hit level 10, each level costs more than 10 stars. Levels 11–15 are 15⭐ each. Levels 16–20 are 20⭐ each. For example, to go from 9th to 10th level is 10⭐ as normal and then from 10th to 11th level is 15⭐.</p>
<p>In order to gain levels at prestige levels, characters are required to participate in heroic bounties. A character cannot gain the last star for their current prestige level unless they have successfully completed a bounty that rewards them at least ⭐⭐⭐⭐ in difficulty. They can gain gold and other rewards as normal.</p>
<h2 id="playing-outside-your-level">Playing Outside Your Level</h2>
<p>Characters participating in a Bounty outside their level will receive rewards scaled to their level and the Bounty difficulty.</p>
<p>For every level of difference between your character’s level and the Bounty’s level, subtract or add 1 ⭐ from the rewards earned. Characters will always earn a minimum of 1 ⭐. For example, if a 4th-level character participates in a level 6 ⭐⭐ Bounty and completes it successfully, they will receive ⭐⭐⭐⭐, as they played up 2 levels. However, if the same 4th level character participates in a Level 1 ⭐⭐⭐ Bounty, they will only receive a single ⭐ on a successful completion of the Bounty.</p>
<p>If a higher or lower level character joins a game, GMs should continue to build the Bounty encounters under the assumption that the party is the same level as the Bounty. For example, if a level 4 character joins a level 2 Bounty with four other players, then you would build the encounter around a party of five level 2 characters.</p>
<p>The gold you receive is directly bound to the level of the Bounty, not your character level. A level 5 character does not receive the amount of gold for a level 5 character when they play in a level 2 Bounty. They will receive the amount of gold equal to level 2 according to the chart.</p>
<h2 id="settlements">Settlements</h2>
<p>The future of Golarion rests in the hands of you heroes to rebuild the scraps of society into a safe and thriving bastion. In Children of Worldweep, you will have the ability to build up pre-existing outposts that can evolve into towns and even kingdoms if you are ambitious enough.</p>
<p><code>… usually nothing more than two roads and a collection of shoddily built hovels, governed poorly by the local band of self-serving thugs and exploitative merchants that happen to have taken what pitiful power there is in each settlement. They use it to bully and aggrandize themselves, insufficiently veiling their own knowledge that their small-minded dominions are teetering on the edge of devastation, just a single crisis away from plummeting into uncaring oblivion and death. To even call these poor excuses for humanoid cohabitation settlements is an affront to the memory of grand cities and quaint villages of yore, but, alas, it is what we are stuck with in these brutal, uncivilized times...</code></p>
<p><strong>- Travelogue of Souram, elven bard. Written approximately 650 years after the Heroes’ March.</strong></p>
<h1 id="a-place-called-home">A Place Called Home</h1>
<p>The World of Worldweep is dotted with a few precious points of light amidst decay, danger, and wilderness. These are the Settlements of the Children of the Worldweep. Settlements will rise and fall as the story unfolds, but building them up will require grit, determination, and the ability to fight back against the dangers of the Weep. All players will start in Moonlit Village and can venture out to other settlements when you have the experience and strength to do so or if someone takes pity on you and brings you along.</p>
<h2 id="settlement-leveling-and-rewards">Settlement Leveling and Rewards</h2>
<p>Settlements have levels just like players which represent the general infrastructure and power level present in a given location. Structures, like Shops, also have a level which can not be higher than the Settlement’s level. Settlements and Structures level by accumulating ✨, which are predominantly earned by players completing Settlement Bounties, and function much like ⭐ do for players. Unless a Settlement Bounty is specifically awarding ✨ to a Structure or Road, they will count towards leveling the Settlement itself.</p>
<h3 id="settlement-bounties-✨">Settlement Bounties ✨</h3>
<p>Settlement Bounties will be posted to special channels by the Writing Team. Each Settlement Bounty may only be run once, unless otherwise indicated. Once the Settlement Bounty is posted, GMs and players can apply. After the Writing Team has selected a GM, the GM will select a group of up to 6 players to play in the bounty.</p>
<p>Settlements and Shops use the same star rules as players, so they gain more stars for higher level bounties and fewer stars for lower level bounties.</p>
<h3 id="settlement-bounty-rewards">Settlement Bounty Rewards</h3>
<p>Settlement Bounties do not reward stars or gold to players unless specifically stated otherwise and each character can only take part in one Settlement Bounty per week. However, Settlement Bounties do not count against your weekly cap, so you can earn all rewards from a Settlement Bounty in addition to a regular Bounty.</p>
<p>GMs receive ⭐ equal to the ✨ awarded, receiving half rewards on a failure. If a Settlement Bounty awards a Bounty Reward, a GM can elect to receive that instead of these stars, but they may not receive both.</p>
<h2 id="roads">Roads</h2>
<p>Roads can be built starting from any Settlement-adjacent hex (including Grand Guildhalls), granting the benefits described in the Travel section. Settlement Bounties will sometimes award Roads, but players can also craft Road tiles. Crafting a Road tile takes six people four days and requires a successful craft check against the basic DC for the current Settlement level. For example, a level one Settlement would need six people with at least one person out of your six succeeding on a DC 15 crafting check to complete a road after four days of work. When building Roads, you must downgrade difficult terrain step-by-step. The steps are greater difficult terrain, difficult terrain, normal terrain and road/bridge, which means turning one tile of greater difficult terrain into a Road will require three Road tile improvements. Players participating in this Road building cannot do other downtime activities during the days they are spending building Roads; however, they are still considered as being able to go back to the Settlement at the end of the day. Players building Roads are also not eligible to play in Bounties during their roadwork time.</p>
<h2 id="homes">Homes</h2>
<p>A character can have their own home in a Settlement by simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying the home price (minimum 1500 gold) that can be split by up to four players</li>
<li>Naming up to four total owners of the house</li>
<li>Providing a description and optionally a name for the desired home</li>
</ul>
<p>When players are ready to buy a home, simply post it in the #Heroines’ Hearts [RP] channel and tag @pathfinder2e with the listed items above. Once this has been established, then your home will be built and a Discord channel created. Homes can be used as workshops for crafters and a general place for your character (and up to three others) to live in. Homes can also securely store items that adventurers do not wish to lug around.</p>
<p>Despite the name, a “home” doesn’t need to look like a home. It’s simply a general-purpose building owned by one or more characters or organizations that can be used as a space for RP and Downtime Activities.</p>
<p>For example, a home with room for Crafting (a Downtime Activity) can be described as a workshop. A typical single-room house might look like some private space for sleeping and eating, a common room for welcoming guests, and a workshop for Crafting.</p>
<p>When a character dies, any of their belongings in the home disappear with them. Characters may not leave wills or otherwise indicate future ownership of their belongings. Homes that are not owned by any living individuals fall derelict and cannot be passed on to a new owner.</p>
<h2 id="grand-guildhalls">Grand Guildhalls</h2>
<p>Guilds of all kinds can be established by players. They all have their own purpose and edicts and are a way for players to collaborate, roleplay an organization, and work towards a common goal. To become a formally recognized guild, a Grand Guildhall must be built as the seat of power for a Guild. Without a Grand Guildhall, groups of characters can accomplish many things and even choose a name for their organization, but they cannot receive Guild Bounties to advance their goals.</p>
<p>To establish a guild:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one Guildleader must be named.</li>
<li>A Guild description must be written up.</li>
<li>Pick up to a maximum group of 4 leaders. At least one must be selected.</li>
<li>Your Grand Guildhall must be purchased in a settlement. The minimum price for a Grand Guildhall is 4000gp, the cost can only be split among the founding members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once established, a Grand Guildhall works in the same way as a Settlement, with a few differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Guildhalls take a week to construct.</li>
<li>A Grand Guildhall is established in a hex adjacent to a Settlement. It is, for all intents and purposes, a part of that Settlement.</li>
<li>A Grand Guildhall is ruled by the leadership of the Guild, as defined by the Guild Charter.</li>
<li>A Grand Guildhall shares a level with its guild. Like all settlement buildings, it cannot have a higher level than the Settlement it is a part of.</li>
<li>A guild can only have one Grand Guildhall, but it can be moved to another city for 2000gp and follows the same rules for construction as normal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guild-bounties">Guild Bounties</h3>
<p>As a special sort of Settlement, a Grand Guildhall will occasionally receive Guild Bounties. Through these bounties, Grand Guildhalls may attract merchants and artisans. The level of any merchants and artisans in a Grand Guildhall is limited by the level of the Settlement the Grand Guildhall is attached to.</p>
<p>The Writing Team provides bounties to guilds on a request-only basis. Guild Leaders should ping <code>morbin time</code> with their requests. The requests can be as specific or general as the Leaders wish, but the Bounties provided may or may not comply with the requests. These requests are how the Writers know what goals the Guild wishes to pursue, but the Worldweep is a place of fickle fortunes where best laid plans must contend with the harsh reality of a world with little security.</p>
<p>A provided Bounty may be run only once, unless it specifies otherwise. Likewise, provided Bounties expire after two weeks unless they specify otherwise. The Guild will usually have to fund a Bounty by paying gold scaled to the level of the Bounty, with the specifics being provided by the Writing Team.</p>
<p>When the Guild funds a Bounty, they post it and GMs as well as players can apply to run the game. The GM cannot be a member of the Guild with any of their characters. You cannot participate as a player in both a Guild Bounty and a Settlement Bounty in the same week.</p>
<h2 id="traveling-between">Traveling Between</h2>
<p>Traveling from one Settlement to the next requires real time. Refer to the section below to determine how much time it takes for you to travel from one settlement to another. During this time, your character is not able to participate in Settlement Bounties or Travel Bounties, or begin other Bounties until they have arrived at their destination. Additionally, if you are traveling for every day in a given week, you do not gain the normal weekly PBP stars on the Sunday after that week.</p>
<p>Worldweep uses a simplified method of travel based on speed.</p>

<table>

</table><p>Regular terrain counts as one hex, difficult terrain counts as two hexes, greater difficult terrain counts as three hexes, and improved roads count as half a hex. Crossing a river counts as difficult terrain unless there is a bridge or settlement on that hex. When traveling by water or air, all terrain costs half of a hex.</p>
<p>If characters travel on mounts or other vehicles, the speed of those vehicles is used instead. If characters travel on vehicles or mounts that can continue without sleep (including any need for sleep for the vehicle pilot), they may travel up to three times as far as otherwise indicated as long as pilots and crew are available.</p>
<p>In order to pilot a vehicle for overland travel, 10 + your relevant piloting skill must meet or exceed the DC for the vehicle.</p>
<h3 id="travel-checks">Travel Checks</h3>
<p>Traveling in WorldWeep is anything but safe. When you travel from one place to another, make a Travel Check. The skills you may use depend on your mode of transport:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Skills</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Foot</td>
<td>Survival</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mount</td>
<td>Nature or Survival</td>

<tr>
<td>Conjured Mount</td>
<td>Survival or Arcana, Religion, Nature, or Occultism as appropriate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vehicle</td>
<td>Piloting check</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>The DC for the check is 13 + (days traveled). You cannot “camp” between two destinations to “split up” the journey.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You arrive 2 days earlier than expected. Minimum of 8 hours traveled.</p>
<p><strong>Success:</strong> All goes as planned.</p>
<p><strong>Failure:</strong> You arrive 2 days later than you expected.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> You become lost or otherwise in danger. Ping <code>morbin time</code> and arrange for a rescue bounty.</p>
<h3 id="guides">Guides</h3>
<p>Guides can be hired to assist on the journey. Guides are available of any level up to the level of the Settlement. The Guide has a relevant check modifier of 8+level. Guides cost 5*level gold per day. Groups may only hire a single Guide.</p>
<h3 id="rescue-bounty">Rescue Bounty</h3>
<p>A Rescue Bounty can be played in by anybody who wishes to participate, limited by the GM who wishes to run the Bounty. Rescue Bounties will appear in #bounty-board. The party that needs to be rescued can choose who they wish to rescue them and the GM to run the Bounty. If saved, the rescuee(s) are brought back to their place of origin. If the rescue attempt fails, another search party can go out and attempt another rescue. This can happen indefinitely.</p>
<p>Rescue Bounty rating = [Average Level of the party needing rescue rounded down]⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>The rescuee(s) do(es) not have to participate in the Bounty. Rescuers do not receive any rewards for rescuing the lost. The GM will receive ⭐ and the appropriate gold for that star. If the lost had a mount, they must pass a DC 11 flat check or else they lose their mount. The DC is lowered to 5 if the mount also belongs to someone as an Animal Companion rather than just solely a mount.</p>
<p>Journeying across the apocalypse is dangerous. Prepare wisely.</p>
<p><code>My water has run out and I haven't slept in days. I wonder if anybody is going to come for me. If you find this, tell Adrianna I get it now. I would do anything to have her call me a coward right now. It would be better than this broken ankle or leg or whatever I have. I hear the wolves again...</code></p>
<p><em>- Final entry in the journal of Alex Willowstar.</em></p>
<h3 id="group-travel">Group Travel</h3>
<p>If more than one person is traveling, every character that is not exclusively a passenger in a vehicle must make a check. If characters are using different modes of travel, they must use the check appropriate to their mode of travel. The amount of days traveled is determined by the slowest speed in the group; however, the group receives the benefit of the highest check. If the best check result is better than a critical failure, they all arrive together. If it is a critical failure, the group must be rescued as a whole.</p>
<p>Two characters from the same player may not travel together.</p>
<h2 id="travel-bounty">Travel Bounty</h2>
<p>An alternate method of travel allows for players to group up with a minimum of 4 players and a GM to run a Travel Bounty. The Bounty will always have the same prompt of traveling from one town to another. The rating of the Bounty increases in difficulty the farther and farther you have to travel.</p>
<p>Bounty rating = Level [Hexes traveled/3] ⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>Travel Bounties count against your weekly cap. Unlike most Bounties, when you complete the Bounty, you gain no Bounty Rewards Gold, you only gain stars. You may never participate in more than one Travel Bounty in a given week. The missing gold represents the cost of the journey. At the completion of the Bounty, however, you instantly arrive at your destination.</p>
<p>There are no level restrictions with Travel Bounties in terms of levels. Characters of all levels may travel together.</p>
<h1 id="shops-and-artisans">Shops and Artisans</h1>
<p>As your Settlement gains villagers, merchants and artisans will open shops and provide services for players. Runes and items can only be purchased and applied in towns. Every Shop has its own level which limits the level of items available at that Shop. For example, a 3rd-level Shop cannot carry 4th-level items. Shops can have their levels increased through Settlement Bounties. Blacksmiths, Academies, Runesmiths, etc. can only apply or use spells that are at or below the current level of the shop, rounded up.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of resources post-Worldweep, you can only purchase 1x[Shop Level] of each item that the shopkeeper offers. Example: If the blacksmith has a level 3 Shop, then you can purchase 3 daggers, 3 swords, 3 spears and 3 axes per week. Likewise, Shops cannot make or sell equipment made from uncommon special materials like adamantine or orichalcum unless they have access to them via a resource hex or a trade route. These will occasionally be available as the result of Bounties. The type of Shops available are just a general guide of what’s available. Each Shop will list what they have available.</p>

</table><h3 id="academy">Academy</h3>
<p>An Academy is where players can go to learn Skills and Spells and retrain Feats and purchase Formulae. Learning a Spell follows table 4-3 on page 238 of the Core Rulebook. The max level Spell available at the Academy is Shop level/2 to learn.</p>
<p>You can only retrain the Feats with levels equal or lower than the level of the building. For example, you can only retrain Feats at level 2 if the building is also level 2 or higher, and you can only retrain Feats at level 3 if the building is also level 3 or higher.</p>
<p>Formulae follow the same rule as other Shops as you can only buy the level of Formula equal to the level of the Academy.</p>
<h3 id="apothecary">Apothecary</h3>
<p>This merchant sells potions, mutagens, alchemical concoctions, and medical kits for players to purchase.</p>
<h3 id="blacksmith">Blacksmith</h3>
<p>Blacksmiths provide armor and weapons to adventurers. Some blacksmiths can also apply runes and that’ll be indicated in the title of the Shop.</p>
<h3 id="curio-shop">Curio Shop</h3>
<p>A Curio Shop sells common magic items but not runes. Curios are always willing to buy any item from players and will always pay half the appraised value of an item. Unlike most shops, a Curio only sells common items up to half its level (rounded up). For example: at level 4, a Curio Shop can sell level 2 items. At level 5 it will sell level 3 items.</p>
<p>The real value of a Curio, however, is its selection of special items unique only to that Curio. These special items may be up to three levels higher than the Shop, but might only be available for a limited time and on an inconsistent basis.</p>
<h3 id="general-store">General Store</h3>
<p>Everyone needs a General Store. This merchant sells foodstuffs and survival gear such as rope, poles, rations, backpacks, clothing, etc. Non-magical items of various levels are located here.</p>
<h3 id="runesmith">Runesmith</h3>
<p>A Runesmith is necessary and the only way to apply runes to weapons and purchase them. Occasionally, a traveling Runesmith will come to the Adventurer’s guild and you can purchase runes and have him apply them there.</p>
<h3 id="shrine">Shrine</h3>
<p>Shrines are places of worship for Clerics. They may provide services like magical healing or ritual casting, depending on the deity. Clerics/Champions/etc. can use these as temporary shelters and places of rest.</p>
<p>As a Shrine gains levels, the attendants there may learn rituals they are willing to teach players. There is no gold cost for this, but learning a ritual takes one day for each level of the ritual. Characters may teach rituals to one another, but it takes a day per level for both the student and the teacher.</p>
<p>Rituals learned from Shrines in Worldweep are limited in a way not typical of Pathfinder games: they must be learned at every level and cannot be automatically heightened. If you want to cast Level 4 Elemental Sentinel, you need to know Level 4 Elemental Sentinel.</p>
<p>A Shrine will automatically gain one ritual of a (Level/2 - 2) at every even level, starting at level 6. They may also gain access to rituals through Settlement Bounties. Characters can learn these Rituals by spending the required time at the Shrine in meditation, service, and learning.</p>
<h3 id="stablemaster">Stablemaster</h3>
<p>A Stablemaster is the only place where you can get a horse and animal companions if yours are killed or lost if you do not want to spend a week to reclaim another animal companion. The prices are on Table 6–7 of Core Rulebook page 294. Animal companions cost the same amount as a riding horse (8 gp) to replace immediately rather than a week of real time. Stable masters also can provide different types of pets as listed in their shops. This is the only place you can buy barding and equipment for animal companions or mounts for the specific companions that the stablemaster houses.</p>
<h3 id="traveling-merchant">Traveling Merchant</h3>
<p>Occasionally, a traveling merchant will find its way to any town and offer goods that you may not have access to and might even have some things you may never see again. During that time an announcement will be made, and if you are currently in that area you can use the same resources that town has. Take advantage of the traveler while you can!</p>
<h2 id="receipts">Receipts</h2>
<p>Every town will have shops and occasionally the traveling merchant will pop into town. Whenever you purchase something, what’s important is to make a note in the correct channel that you have spent the gold. An example would look like:</p>
<p><code>@pathfinder2e [Character] purchased a +1 and striking rune and had it applied to my weapon for a total of 100gp.</code></p>
<p>Then subtract the gold from your character sheet later. This is your receipt for yourself and for others.</p>
<p>This is necessary for every kind of transaction, even between players. Do this in any of the RP channels and be sure to tag each other and list the transaction.</p>
<h2 id="worldweep-unique-mechanics">Worldweep Unique Mechanics</h2>
<h3 id="that-time-i...">That Time I…</h3>
<p>If you wish to play in a Bounty that is too low of a level for you, you can become an unreliable narrator and use the “That time I…” mechanic. This mechanic allows you to play a character in a bounty 4 or more levels below your character’s level. Your character de-levels to the Bounty’s level range and can only use items at the new level or lower. When using this mechanic, your character cannot permanently die. However, if the party fails the Bounty or your character dies, they will gain <strong>Wounded 1</strong> for the next Bounties they participate in, equal to the amount of levels you de-leveled to play. You gain the base level of gold for the bounty based on its rating and never more than that.</p>
<h3 id="point-of-no-return">Point of No Return</h3>
<p>During your adventures, you may run into a point where your players may have to make permanent choices. These are <strong>Points of No Return.</strong> Your players will then make a decision on whether or not they will move forward with the decision as a group. Players who do not wish to continue will, canonically, have their characters leave the party and retain only the listed Bounty rewards. However they will continue playing the session but will receive none of the consequences OR rewards gained after the Point. Even if the party is wiped, players who agreed to leave do not suffer the consequences. However if the party discovers a trove of 1000 gp, those who leave will not gain a single coin from the trove. GMs will not receive the rewards from these events, regardless of if the party succeeds. However, this is not a mechanic that allows for GMs to give extra rewards to players or themselves. Rewards are still strictly bound to the treasure table unless otherwise specified in the Bounty. This mechanic can, however, be used for the party to collectively take on challenges that the GM wishes to give to the party without worry of permanent death.</p>
<p>This is meant as a safety valve to keep the players’ expectations from being dashed. At the end of the day, this game is about having fun. Losing a character you have invested in when joining a low level Bounty is not fun. Giving your players a way to continue playing, but also not die, is a mechanic for fun in a world where permanent death is the default. This mechanic exists so sudden Bounty difficulty changes have a safety check so they don’t feel pressured into playing something they don’t want to.</p>
<h3 id="crafting">Crafting</h3>
<p>Players will be allowed to craft items for other players in their downtime between adventures. In Worldweep, we will be using the Treasure Vault crafting rules. Crafting is done in real-time. If something requires 4 days to craft, then it takes 4 days in-game and in real time. You cannot craft for the Earn Income activity. You must craft using the 4 days + cost rules and cannot spend more days to reduce the cost. You can acquire a formula for an item from the same sorts of shops that sell that item and are level-limited exactly as all items are.</p>
<p>The Inventor feat allows you to craft a formula, which must be for an item not prohibited by the access rules. (Typically, a Common or Uncommon item only.) The raw materials for crafting can be acquired in any settlement, provided it has access to the rare or specific materials required. Crafters can <strong>only</strong> sell their items to players once they establish a workshop. Players then need to to make a tagged receipt as shown below in the receipts section of the rules. Example below:</p>
<p><code>@player1 [Character] sells +1 striking longsword to @player2 [Character] for 150gp</code></p>
<p>High level magic items require rare materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 8 and up items require access to Adamantine, Dawnsilver, or Darkwood</li>
<li>Level 16 and up items require access to Orichalcum</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crafting-vehicles">Crafting Vehicles</h2>
<p>Building enormous vehicles requires far more people and effort than most crafting tasks. Rather than a single crafting check, Large vehicles levels 5 or higher, as well as Huge and Gargantuan vehicles, require accumulating Victory Points (VP) through a series of crafting checks. While land vehicles can be built anywhere as long as the other requirements are met, waterborne craft must be built in settlements with a dock built.</p>
<p>The primary crafter needs to meet all requirements to attempt the craft. In order to work on such a big vehicle, make a Crafting (trained-only) check following all rules for Complex Crafting, including the days of setup required, setting the DC by level, etc. Assistants, as noted below, also roll a Crafting (trained-only) check. When the Crafting checks are done, instead of completing the vehicle immediately, note down VP as determined by the degree of success of the Crafting checks:</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> Gain 2 VP<br>
<strong>Success:</strong> Gain 1 VP<br>
<strong>Failure:</strong> No VP<br>
<strong>Critical Failure:</strong> Lose 1 VP</p>
<p>Keep track of the VP accumulated on the construction project, as they measure how far the construction has progressed. After noting the current VP in the channel you are crafting in, you may begin the setup process for another Crafting check. The vehicle is finished when the VP total meets or exceeds the threshold in the following table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large vehicles level 5+</strong>: 25 Victory Points</li>
<li><strong>Huge</strong>: 50 Victory Points</li>
<li><strong>Gargantuan</strong>: 100 Victory Points</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary crafter may enlist as many assistants as they can muster. These assistants do not have to meet the requirements for crafting the vehicle, including the level requirement. The primary crafter can choose to either auto-succeed at a successful aid check at the beginning of the project or risk the auto-success by choosing to roll for a critical success at aiding. Either choice will be set as the aid for the project until it has been completed.</p>
<h2 id="the-worldweep-effects">The Worldweep Effects</h2>
<p><strong>Spells</strong><br>
The following spells have become uncastable:<br>
Umbral Extraction<br>
Umbral Mindtheft<br>
Banishment<br>
Shadow Walk<br>
Secret Chest<br>
Ethereal Jaunt<br>
Maze<br>
Gate</p>
<p><strong>Items</strong><br>
Items that create 20 bulk or more that have the [Extradimensional] Tag have become harder to manufacture. Finding the proper weave of dimensional space in the limited space between has become more difficult. Creating an item with an extradimensional space capable of carrying more than 20 bulk has an Incredibly Hard modifier (DC+10). Additionally, the time for crafting these items is twice as long as it would normally take. Items that create less than 21 bulk can be crafted as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Banes</strong><br>
There are currently no banes in effect.</p>
<h2 id="gifts">Gifts</h2>
<p>Characters may not give non-infused consumables above the giftee’s level + 3, any gold, or any permanent magic items to another character without an established in-game Rapport (which can be formed via RP or having been in bounties together) and <strong>personalized</strong> reason to do so. This reason must be specific to the receiver of the gift and not simply applicable to anyone in their position. For example, simply joining a guild is insufficient rapport to establish gifting outside of these bounds. Sales and services are not gifts.</p>
<p>Characters belonging to the same player may not give items or gold to one another in any way or share anything at all with one another.</p>
<h2 id="play-by-post-pbp">Play By Post (PBP)</h2>
<p>All Bounties will be available in both a Play By Post and live game setting to be picked up and run by any GM.</p>
<p>Each GM running a PBP will create a thread in the appropriate PBP channel and host as many players as they’re willing to host. Every player who joins will be required to play or be dropped from the thread as requested. Each week, the GM will award star rewards as per the Bounty rating. This includes both stars and gold per the Bounty rating, but not any special rewards. If the Bounty is rated ⭐ ⭐ ⭐, then players will earn that rating for as long as they match the level of the PBP Bounty is running until it finishes. If they gain levels for any reason during the bounty, even if they are not permitted to mechanically level up, they will gain fewer stars as described above. This way, PBP players can keep pace with live game players.</p>
<p>Pathfinder 2e does not have any strict rules on how PBP should be played, so the GM will instruct players on how they play.</p>
<p>Some PBP Bounties may indicate that they do not count toward your weekly cap. For these Bounties, a character may participate in them even if they are participating in another PBP Bounty elsewhere. These Bounties are likely to also indicate that you may only receive rewards from them once. That includes weekly PBP stars, so these will only reward stars when the Bounty is successfully completed.</p>
<p>If you are in multiple Play-By-Post Bounties, or if you play in a Live Bounty during a week when you are in a Play-By-Post Bounty, you must choose exactly one Bounty that week from which to receive Bounty Rewards. You may not receive Bounty Rewards from more than one source in a single week (unless a Bounty explicitly says so).</p>
<p>Characters may not participate in more than two Play-By-Post Bounties that reward stars that count toward the weekly cap at once.</p>
<p>The intent is for participation in a Play-By-Post Bounty during a week to be exactly equivalent to running a Live Bounty at some point during that week. Rules should be interpreted with this intent in mind. Play-By-Post Bounties of any type should be neither advantageous nor disadvantageous as compared to Live Bounties of the same type.</p>
<h2 id="roleplaying-in-discord">Roleplaying in Discord</h2>
<p>There will be channels within the Discord server tagged with [RP] which will be RP only. You must stay in character here and play as your character. As towns are built and new channels are created, they will bring more places to roleplay. These channels will be strictly moderated, so please do not post memes or post out of character often. If you need to say something OOC, please use parentheses brackets (like this). We will be using bots such as the RPG Sage bot and Tupperbox to encourage roleplaying in these channels. You can roleplay in first or third person as long as it is in character. GMs can interact with players as NPCs by using quotation formatting, done by adding “&gt; ” before a message like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The old man’s finger brushed away the flashing from the tip of his etching tool. He blew away the metal dust that revealed his name before handing the blade off to the adventurer. “You’re welcome, hero.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you may use the Tupper discord bot if you wish. It is not necessary, but it may make for a more immersive experience.</p>
<h2 id="dos-and-donts">Do’s and Dont’s</h2>
<p>You can and will be banned or removed from the game at any point for violating the Discord Terms of Service or our rules.</p>
<h3 id="do">Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Play fairly and cooperatively.</li>
<li>Ask for help or clarification of rules if you have any questions.</li>
<li>Consider being a GM.</li>
<li>Let us know if there’s anything that needs clarifying or fixing.</li>
<li>Use the chat to connect with your fellow players.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dont">Don’t</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use hatespeech of any kind.</li>
<li>Metagame and cheat. Metagaming is at the baseline just memorizing stats of creatures and calling it out. Tactical gameplay is not metagaming. Cheating or lying about progression will result in removal from the game.</li>
<li>PVP. There is absolutely no PVP allowed in this game.</li>
<li>Backseat play for other players.</li>
<li>Harass other players. Any harassment will result in an immediate ban.</li>
<li>Intentionally misread or divine rules that don’t exist just because something isn’t explicitly prohibited. This is a community cooperative game and keeping within the spirit of gaming is more important than gaming the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same rules for the r/Pathfinder2e subreddit apply here. There will be zero tolerance for transphobia, racism, ableism, abuse, sexism, and homophobia. Reports will be taken seriously and any players found to be in violation of these rules will be banned immediately from the server. We will not tolerate any kind of hate speech or exclusionary bigoted behavior.</p>
<p>=</p>
<h1 id="worldweep-game-masters">Worldweep Game Masters</h1>
<p>Players who wish to be GMs will be allowed to post in the #bounty-board forum. They can create their own post and can be filled with players of the appropriate levels and amount that the GM wishes to run the game for. You are allowed to run as many games as you’d like and you can gain as many rewards as you’d like. You also can refuse to allow any player if you do not wish to play with them. If there are any issues please bring it up to any of our moderators.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-bounty">Running a Bounty</h2>
<p>Every Bounty will have its own prompt giving you a guideline on how to run the Bounty. The specifics will be up to the GM. For example, a Bounty could say, “A traveling merchant wishes to turn a nest of monsters into a resting point for travelers.”</p>
<p>The GM can make it a nest of rats, birds, demon dogs—whatever you wish, depending on the Bounty’s ⭐ rating. The idea is to make the game as easy for the GM to run as possible. Maps, tokens, monsters can all be done by the GM without running into pauses or awkward breaks in the story telling, as the GM is the one coming up with the encounter. GMs cannot give out items at the end of adventures. GMs can give out consumables and other items to use during the session, but such items are forfeit at the end of the Bounty. For example, you can give players a silver sword to hunt down a werewolf, but they cannot keep the silver sword once the Bounty finishes.</p>
<h2 id="rewards">Rewards</h2>
<p>Award treasure from Bounties according to this table this is <strong>per character</strong>. GMs have discretion to adjust treasure rewards above or below the listed amounts, however, GMs do not gain the <strong>extra</strong> gold given. Only the listed amounts per level, per star. Very rarely, an item will be the reward from a Bounty, in that case the item can only be applied to a character of appropriate level, that is level +- 3. i.e. A 20th level item cannot be given to their 5th level character. The GM can hold the item for their character for later.</p>
<p>##Your Own Story<br>
As a GM, you run your own story based on the thesis of the Bounty. For example, “Bandits have attacked our village! Help!” could be run straight in that bandits have attacked a village. Or, you could run the village as a trap to capture adventurers. Or, the villagers could be sending a message as ghosts waiting to get sent through the Boneyard as their spirits remain waiting for someone to help them pull from their earthbound anchors. You may run the Bounty in whatever manner you desire, so long as it follows the base template of the prompt.</p>
<p>When creating your Bounty, make sure to copy and paste the thread title exactly as the Bounty says, with the only difference being your username after the Bounty number. For example,</p>
<p>[Bounty #0001: pirate’s booty ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐]</p>
<p>Is posted by john as:</p>
<p>[Bounty #0001-john: pirate’s booty ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐]</p>
<p>When your Bounty has been completed, simply tag all of your players and their username and a short comment about the adventure and the rewards given. Take however much time you would like to debrief with one another and then close the thread by right clicking and clicking [Close Thread].</p>
<h2 id="bounty-debriefing">Bounty Debriefing</h2>
<p>At the end of adventures, GMs can export the JSON of characters, dump them into the Bounty thread, tag all their adventurers, and list any boons or extra rewards they received. The next time adventurers take a Bounty, the next GM can be directed to their JSONs and import them into their game. If GMs are not using Foundry, then PDFs of character sheets can be uploaded. Players can also export their own characters for their own records and give them to their next GM. This ensures faster prep time for GMs. If you are not using a VTT with an export function, then you can simply tag all your players and write a short description of their success rewards they have earned. This will house the records of Bounties for everyone and be a way for the next GM or players to download their JSON or PDF into the next game they play. @ each player that was in your party and then drop their JSON into the channel.</p>
<p>GMs can <strong>only</strong> give out gold and stars, unless otherwise specified by the Bounty.</p>
<p>Example rewards tag:<br>
<code>@player1 @player2 @player3 @player4 completed the Bounty successfully and earned ⭐⭐⭐ and 20 gold.</code></p>
<p>For players looking to find their sheets/JSON. All you have to do is go to the search bar and type “mentions:@(username) in:bounty-board” and it will list your most recent mentions. This is the smoothest and easiest way to get your next game going.</p>
<p>If a character dies in a Bounty, the GM must tag @pathfinder2e.</p>
<h2 id="ghoran-calls-for-aid">Ghoran Calls for Aid</h2>
<p>Sometimes, adventuring parties will have need of assistance from individuals and guilds during the course of their adventures. In order to Call for Aid you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to a home, guild hall, or relevant RP thread within a Settlement;</li>
<li>RP the request for assistance;</li>
<li>Receive an RPed response to the request; and</li>
<li>Receive the response in a timely manner so as not to hold up the bounty (usually about 10 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<p>A helper can do one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lend a hand:</strong> The helper may journey with the party to help complete a skill check or challenge. They may receive buffs, but not provide them to party members. This only covers assistance for a single situation, like asking for help unlocking a box or helping a sick companion. You also can’t ask for help for a hypothetical situation or a situation that hasn’t happened yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grab a snacc:</strong> The helper may journey with the party to a camp and can venture somewhere that isn’t considered dangerous, that the party has already cleared to ensure it’s safety. They can provide a single item, spell, or infusion. No temporary item, spell effect, or infusion can last longer than 24 hours. Items given this way are Gifts (even if only on Loan) and must follow the relevant rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot Call for Aid from a character more than three levels higher than the bounty level, nor may you receive any item, spell, or effect from a character who’s level is more than 3 levels higher than the bounty level.</p>
<p>The helpers cannot participate in combat or otherwise experience harm, if for example a rogue critically fails a disarm trap challenge, the trap does engage, but the rogue is not harmed and leaves the party to go back home.</p>
<p>Each instance of aid costs ⭐️ worth of gold. If no gold can be removed from the bounty, the GM removes bonus rewards, guild rewards, settlement rewards, or special rewards at their descretion. GMs may discuss with players the order of reword loss, but always makes the final decision. Players should know which reward is being lost prior to deciding on whether to Call of Aid. GMs should seriously consider prohibiting aid that would effectively cause the bounty to be a failure on account of stripped rewards.</p>
<p>GMs can refuse to allow aid for any reason. They should always prohibit aid that isn’t feasible for the bounty or if it would trivialize a significant portion of it. Likewise, GMs should construe “challenge” narrowly. This is something like “unlocking a lock” or “researching zombies” and never something that would be better described as an “encounter”.</p>
<h2 id="the-children-of-the-worldweep">The Children of the WorldWeep</h2>
<p>As the game evolves and players give input on the game, the rules may change and we will change the mechanics as we go along. These rules are subject to change and be ironed out further to better accommodate the players and the player base. If you have any questions or any issues please let any of the moderators involved in the Worldweep know. Feel free to open up a ticket to discuss what you would like to see about the game and how it can improve.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-rules">Beyond the Rules</h2>
<p>The Worldweep still is a tabletop roleplaying game. Type in: “?wade-808-3” into heroine of hearts and hit enter. Therefore you will encounter situations that are not covered by specific rules either in this document or the Pathfinder 2e ruleset, like trying to find out about some phenomenon or weirdness in the world. Talk to your GM while playing in a bounty as you would in any traditional table game. Outside of bounties, do your best to roleplay and describe what you are trying to do and gain the attention of the @morbs. The writers will try to make rulings much like GMs would, but we do miss things at times, so pinging us again (without pestering) is encouraged. The spirit of the rules and gameplay and cooperation is tantamount to keeping this entire platform alive. Play within the spirit of having fun and not trying to exploit the rules in some fashion that only benefits you, this goes for both players and GMs.</p>
<p><strong>GMs</strong>: Please stay within the guidelines of the bounties you’ve selected. Afflictions earned by players shouldn’t interfere with other bounties mechanically, but just the player themselves. Do not homebrew afflictions to give to players.</p>
<p><strong>Players</strong>: If you have found some kind of exploit, let us know and we can patch it. The worldweep saga channel is live rules. We want to stay within the spirit of the game.</p>

<p>I would like to thank wealthbeyondmeasure for writing the lore and backstory to this game. Without her, this doesn’t happen. Her and her partner gave life to the Alchemist and without them, none of this happens. I am not creative enough to write this out. Lacydog has done so much in the shadows and named this maniacal project.</p>
<p>I would like to thank tradebaron (who is totally not a dragon) for helping me flesh out mechanics for this game. The entire Pathfinder Infinite crew for helping me with the direction of all the rules.</p>
